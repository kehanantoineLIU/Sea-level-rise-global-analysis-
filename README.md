# Sea level rise (global analysis)
The project aims to assess and predict sea level rise by analyzing sea surface height (SSH) time series data. The main objective is to provide insights into both global and local patterns of sea level rise, offering a comprehensive view of the potential impacts in different regions.

## There are two main goals:
1.Projected global sea level rise  
2.Plotting the local slopes of different SSH time series around the globe

## algoritheme
1. main model is LinearRegression
2. compute the incertainty of our predictions as a function of time
